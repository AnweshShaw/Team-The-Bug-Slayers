# Team-The-Bug-Slayers
It consists of our proposed solution to the problem statement of "Document Creation Using QR Code" of the Coding Sprint Hackathon 2022 hosted by SRMIIC.
We have used HTML5 and CSS3 for the frontend part of our website.
The backend part is managed by a flask server.
The generation of a Dynamic QR Code after a regular interval of time, generating a 6 digit OTP and sending it to the user by mail is managed by using Python and its modules like qrcode,time,random, and smtplib.
